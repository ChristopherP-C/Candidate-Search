# Candidate-Search

  ## Description
There are a plethora of potential employable developers on GitHub, I wanted an easier way to find them.
This project is made to make finding choice candidates from GitHub easier by showing their key information for potential employers to read and follow up on.
This makes quickly finding a list of potential employees quick and allows them to be saved to be viewed or contacted later
This project helped teach me how to use API calls in React to create a rsponsive static website

  ## Usage
  When visiting the site users are presented with a random candidate from GitHub, which they can either reject, accept, or email directly.
